## Week one 

### Kulikowki-2012 ; Definition of Biomedical informatics 
- theme of the paper is formally defining a set of core philiosphies and high level concepts that make up Biomedical Informatics, and how graduate training should attempt to address/teach them 
#### Intro
- Basically, trying to idnetify core concepts within BMI that can be used for graduate education
#### Definition of BMI
- Scope and breadth of discipline: BMI investigates and supports reasoning, modeling, simulation, experimentation, and translation across the spectrum from molecules to individuals and to populations, from biological to social systems, bridging basic and clinical research and practice and the healthcare enterprise.
- Theory and methodology: BMI develops, studies, and applies theories, methods, and processes for the generation, storage, retrieval, use, management, and sharing of biomed- ical data, information, and knowledge.
- Technological approach: BMI builds on and contributes to computer, telecommunication, and information sciences and technologies, emphasizing their application in biomedicine.
- Human and social context: BMI, recognizing that people are the ultimate users of biomedical information, draws upon the social and behavioral sciences to inform the design and evaluation of technical solutions, policies, and the evolution of economic, ethical, social, educational, and organizational systems.
- and then they basically go through all of these more rigorously, bascially the TLDR is that BMI spans from basic sci to extremley applied, with multiple sub discplines that are all connected by common core concepts, ie BMI{ Health, Bio, Medical, Dental}-informatics
-

#### people in BMI will come form different backgrounds 
- incoming graduate students will not have a well rounded background, but will likely be reasonably experienced in one 3 majors areas - Bio, informatics, or cognitive/social science

### Mitchell-2011, Whats next in Informatics research 
- reviewing the role of informatics in clinical decision support, starting from early beginnings,, moving to current practices, and finishing with future directions 
- DSS == decision support systems 
#### Early clinical decision support methods 
- One of systems used for  small variety of problems. Lack of networking and electronic records, required direct clinician use (60's-80')
- 90's - rapid growth of computing made it seem like DSS would take off, but faced several key challenges
- Domain challenge - Biologt is complicated and hard to understand \
- Systems challenge - the engineering problems of having standardized record keeping, data management, compute resources etc 
- Usage challenge - making something doctors will actually use 
#### current challenges in DSS
- need to make things that are robust, that are able to 
- "there's too much data" - ie how do we provide a way for clinicians to takw advantage of the numerious levels of information that may be available about a patient( EHR, genomic, transcriptomic, environmental, imaging modalities etc)
- accurate genomic medicine will have require large amounts of genomic data, which is challenging in several(obvious) ways;
- we need the right terminology because we need accurate labels for everything 

#### Sweden's  medical terminology - a case study
- used the Snomed-CT terminology standard for clinical care 
- basically, it was a hard process - adoption on all levels is difficult, translation between swedish and english is tricky, etc 
- Moving one level high from this, the standardization of medical terminology across multiple countries, and therefore languages, presents an even greater challenge, but for an equally great payoff

#### Moving forward with DSS
- not just clinicians can benefit from DSS; supporting car workers, hospital admin etc can also use clinical/genomic data to make decisions 
- a tool is only a good tool if it can change outcomes
- admin needs to stop looking to cut costs in the IT dept
