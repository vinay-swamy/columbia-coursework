## Terminologies 
- special value type, reusable, 
- vocabulary - the corpus of words/phrases and their definitions within a language
- term - word/phrase associated with an atomic meaning
- terminology - finite set of terms w/o conceptual collision
- ontology - knowledgeable set of concepts, modelling hierarchical relationships, and ontologies 

### Bad terminology
- bad terminology leads to poor or ambiguous records, missing data, etc 
- bad terminology has redundancies, terms that meaning the same thing 
#### fixing bad terminology 
- can't keep adding terms (redundancies )
- improve breadth and depth 
- formal editorial policy 

### Good terminologies
- non redundancy, 
- concept permanence 
- terms have non semantic identifiers ie store terms as integers

# 9/20/21
- knowledge is conceptual understanding gained from information stored in  data 
- data are concrete pieces of information(raw signal), generated in the real world as some sort of process.
- information must parsed from data, then collated to become knowledge
- the goal of knowledge representation is to support intelligent reasoning by having explicit and re-usable domain knowledge that is machine interpretable
- formal knowledge is declarative, or procedural  

- expressiveness - scope of what you can represent  
- tractability - how computationally efficient it is to 

#### Terminology design
- pre-coordination
- post-coordination

Key points 
- Reference(SNOMED) and administrative/billing(ICD10) ontologies do not work well for clinicians, ie clinicians dont think in terms of codes
- Billing codes are the most commonly used type of code; however, the financial bias behind these codes distorts data in the patient record
- interface terminologies act as a sort of front end entry point that is easy to use by clinicians; these interfacing terminologies are then
