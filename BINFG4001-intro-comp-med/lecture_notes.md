## Terminologies 
- special value type, resuable, 
- vocabulary - the corpus of words/phrases and their definitions within a language
- term - word/phrase associated with an atomic meaning
- terminology - finite set of terms w/o conceptual collision
- ontology - knowledgebase set of concepts, modelling hiearchical relationships, and ontologies 

### Bad terminology
- bad terminology leads to poor or ambiguous records, missing data, etc 
- bad terminology has redundancies, terms that meaning the same thing 
#### frixing bad terminology 
- can't keep adding terms (redundancies )
- improve breadth and depth 
- formal editorial policy 

### Good terminologies
- non redundancy, 
- concept permanance 
- terms have non semantic identifiers ie store terms as integers
